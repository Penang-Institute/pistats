Penang Institute is proud to present Key Penang Statistics, a portal dedicated to socioeconomic statistics about the state of Penang. Whatâ€™s more, it comes in interactive format, powered by [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/penang.institute).

These dashboards illustrate trends and patterns in an easily comprehensible form, which will hopefully inspire users to communicate with the data in effective and cogent ways.

Users may download graphics as images, PDFs or PowerPoint presentation. The data is also provided for download.
